    <h1>Questions to Help You Find Your Purpose</h1>
    <h2>
      Answer these questions as honestly as possible. Take the necessary time to
      think through each one of them before moving on. This is extremely
      important.
    </h2>
    <p><em>Think</em> about questions 1 and 2 without writing them down.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Why do you want to achieve your Ultimate Goal?</li>
      <li>
        Why is that so important to you or why does THAT matter (in relation to
        your goal)?
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Why is your answer to question #2 important to you (in relation to
          your goal)?
        </p>
        <textarea></textarea>
        <p>
          Does this answer fell deep-rooted? Could it go deeper? Ask yourself
          "why" as many times as is needed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Who (besides yourself) could potentially benefit from you reaching
          your goal?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What are the 3 biggest sacrifices, or things you'll need to give up,
          to achieve your goal?
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <input type="text" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <input type="text" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <input type="text" />
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Are you willing to sacrifice these things?</p>
        <input type="checkbox" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Whether you work hard for you goal or give up halfway through, time
          will keep ticking. How can you prepare your mind now to help you
          through those hard times WHEN they come? What can you focus on when
          you don't want to push forward toward your goal?

          goal?
